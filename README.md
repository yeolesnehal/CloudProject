File operations portal demo:

The project idea is to develop a 3-tier web application that provides a portal for authorized users to store and maintain their files. The authorized users can login and perform operations on the files such as upload them to S3 and track the file metadata to database along with delete, update and download. The application leverages AWS components to provide highly scalable, fault-tolerant and reliable architecture. With this web application, authorized users are able to perform following operations:


1. Upload file to S3 bucket and store the file metadata in database

2. Download the files through cloudfront URL

3. Update already uploaded files

4. Delete the uploaded files


Features List:

1. Sign up form for new users to create an account

2. Login page to allow authorized users to login.

3. Home screen that displays information about user and the file metadata such as upload time, Description etc.

4. Allow authorized users to upload files in S3. The file size should not exceed 10MB.

5. Allow authorized users to download files through CloudFront.

6. List the files uploaded in S3 bucket alongwith the URL to browse and download the file.
User can logout using the Logout button.
